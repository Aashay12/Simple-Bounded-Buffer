# Bounded-Buffer-Prototype (AKA Producer Consumer Queue)
This is a simple producer consumer prototype that implements synchronization using Semaphores to tackle the "Bounded Buffer Problem"

## If you wish to read my blog on this please visit - 


# Description
- Run Main.java to spin up a producer-consumer buffer.
-  Run MutexExample or SemaphoreExample to play around with locks and threads

- You can play around with production/cosmumption rate in the runner class and also remove the sempaphre code completetly if you wish to understand what deadlock looks like
